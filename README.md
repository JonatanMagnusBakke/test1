**Alien**
An alien meets you and it asks you to teach it how to brush its teeth. Assume
that the alien has teeth exactly like yours, and is as smart as you, but it
needs a clear step-by-step instruction. List the steps. Be as detailed as
you can. (Example: Hold the toothpaste with your left hand; turn the cap
anti-clockwise)

**Answer:**
First you pick up and hold the toothpast with you left hand, then you use you right hand to open the toothpast by turning the cap anti-clockwise.
Now that the toothpast is open you now grab the toothbrush with your right hand on the handle of the toothbrush. Now bring the toothbrush close to the head of the toothpast and squeeze the toothpast so that a fingernail sized toothpast is on the brush of the toothbrush.
Now with the toothpast on the toothbrush you bring the toothbrush head inside your mouth and place it on you frontteeth so that the past on the brush is in contact with your tooth. Now you gently move you hand side to side while you maintain contact to your teeth with the brush head. While doing this now slowly move your hand around to hit all your upper and lower teeth.
